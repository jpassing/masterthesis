For their valuable feedback, perceptive criticisms and fruitful discussions, I
would like to thank the supervisors of this thesis, Martin von Löwis and 
Alexander Schmidt. 

Not only their support, but also having created the opportunity for me to
work with the Windows NT kernel and address the technically challenging topic
of dynamic tracing has been highly appreciated.
